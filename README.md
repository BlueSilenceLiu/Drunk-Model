# Drunk-Model
## Information
You can run the file then click "?" at the right bottom side
Or these are the text that help you learn about this model:
```
Suppose that a drunk drank too much and could not go along a straight line.
He starts his 'journey' from a street lamp.
Suppose his moving follows the following rules:

1.Turn to a random direction.
2.Move forward for 1 metre.
3.Back to 1.

Suppose after a n times' moving,
His distance to the street lamp is L.
What is the numerical relation between n and L?

Because the moving have a random progress,
The L is unpredictable.                 _
So we can only say the relation between L (the average value of all possible L-s) and n.

After calculation we found out that:
_    _
L = âˆšn
Now This model is used to calculate if this is right.

Also, this model can also explain the Brown Motion.
```
By the way, if you want to know how do we calculate, look at this:

## About us
We are a team (only one person) that provides good products.  
You may say: `You are lying!`  
Well, it's a pity that you are ~~right~~ <b>WRONG</b>!  
For example, this is one of our products (A simulater which simulate the genetic):

[^text] Suppose the moving is spreaded to two direction: Motion of x-axis and Motion of y-axis.  
Then suppose they are X and Y.
Suppose each step is l and on x and y axis are $$\overline{x} and \overline{y}$$
Then 
$$ X = x_{1} + x_{2} + ... + x_{n} 
Y = y_{1} + y_{2} + ... + y_{n} $$
Acording to the *Pythagoras Theorem*
$$ 
( \overline{L} )^{2} = X^{2} + Y^{2}
=(x_{1} + x_{2} + ... + x_{n} )^{2} + ( y_{1} + y_{2} + ... + y_{n} )^{2}
=x^{2}_{1} + x^{2}_{2} + ... + x^{2}_{n} + 2 x_{1} x_{2} + 2 x_{1}x_{3} + ... + 2 x_{n-1} x_{n} + y^{2}_{1}......
=x^{2}_{1} + x^{2}_{2} + ... + x^{2}_{n} + y^{2}_{1} + y^{2}_{2} + ... + y^{2}_{n}     (everyone of \{x_{n},n \in \mathbb{N} \} multiply another is either positive or negative, as a result, in an average situation the sum of the products is zero)
=n \overline{x}^{2} + n \overline{y}^{2}
=n(\overline{x}^{2} + \overline{y}^{2})
=n l^{2}

\because \overline{L} ^{2} = n l^{2}
\therefore \overline{L} = \sqrt{n l^{2}}
=\sqrt{n} l
$$
Now because l = 1
therefore, $$\overline{L} = \sqrt{n}$$
